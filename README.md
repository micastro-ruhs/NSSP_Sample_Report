# An example guide to NSSP Sample Reports

Hello everyone and thank you for your interest in the presentation.

WIP: There are a few items I want to expand upon, including:
1. Updating the readme.
2. Add sections for the first half of the paired R markdown script.
3. Re-format the python script section headers to be in parity with the R markdown script.
4. Add sections for the latter half of the script that includes graphical generation and outputting to a docx document.
5. Transitioning to other potential uses of retrieving NSSP data/summaries through ESSENCE.


# An overview of the keyring concept

For many operations, Windows will store credentials in a user directory. This can help a user access and maintain their logins.
